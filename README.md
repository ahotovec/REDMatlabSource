These are the “source” codes I’ll be translating into Python. There’s quite a bit here, and I may be missing a few pieces.

The currently fully functional code is run through MULTDETECTlongterm.m. Kate’s notes on how to use it are stored in README.docx. Kate’s start on “RED” is run through redMain.m, and the start of documentation is in Realtime_REDdocumentation.docx. Extensive documentation on the codes on which Kate’s are based, written by Josh Carmichael, is in RaCorrelationTutorial.pdf.

Everything else is functions, including most of the stuff in the MultipletPrograms folder.
